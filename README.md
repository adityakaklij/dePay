# dePay

dePay is a unified payment getaway that gives us a seamless, secure and decentralise gateway with end-to-end analytics.

For any B2C business, to receive a payment in any type, some form of the gateway is required. But all the service providers are completely centralised and always track all the transactions. That are happening in the business.

To reduce this hassle, dePay plays a key role to get transactions completed without any central authority to confirm or track the transactions. These centralised systems have complete data from it’s users to it’s requirements and the data of the business itself.
So our product solves exactly the same issue. We remove the requirement of centralised middleware, we refrain from collecting user data, maintaining the utmost security and privacy as possible.

Some of the existing drawbacks:

Any other decentralised payment gateway present today uses preferably a single blockchain.

The Business doesn't get personalised updates about every single transaction(small or big).

Chat assistance and FAQs can be discussed anonymously.

Centralise platforms showcase advertisements based on user data collected during his/her every interaction with the application. Therefore they are not 100% reliable and secure.

So dePay solves each and every drawback mentioned above.

dePay supports multiple blockchains on the same platform.

dePay uses push protocol to get the notifications using blockchain, personalised updates are sent to the business through telegram and push protocol.
